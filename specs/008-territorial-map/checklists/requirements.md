# Specification Quality Checklist: Mapa e visualização territorial

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1: 16/16 items pass; este foi o gate histórico anterior ao planejamento.
- References to current Leaflet behavior and open technology alternatives appear only as baseline evidence and decision boundaries; no technology is prescribed by the requirements or success criteria.
- Estado atual: spec, plano e T001–T055 foram reconciliados após o merge `46b22d1` de `origin/development@10fdb8b`; uma nova análise independente continua obrigatória antes de `$speckit-implement`.
- Environmental extensions remain outside the minimum map by explicit scope despite IMP-005 integration; IHFR remains conditional on IMP-006 implementation, integration, reconciliation, and scientific approval.
